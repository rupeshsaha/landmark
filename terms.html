                where created, displayed or accessed. 6.3 Communications.
                Although we provide a platform through the Site and the
                Services through which third-parties may communicate, Company
                is not involved in those third-party communications and is not
                responsible or liable under any circumstances for the content
                of any third-party communications, or for any absence of
                communications by a third-party. The contents of such
                third-party communications are determined solely by the
                third-party responsible for the communications, and not
                Company. We are only responsible for the content of
                information issued directly by us. You acknowledge and agree
                that you will address any issues or concerns about third-party
                communications with the responsible third-party by contacting
                said third-party directly and not Company. Company shall not
                become involved in any matters pertaining to third-party
                communications except where the issue is solely attributable
                to a malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in
                connection with the Services. 6.4 Renter Screening. As part of
                the Services, Users may be permitted to submit information
                through the Site for the purpose of conducting a User
                background check or screening on behalf of a property manager
                or owner (a “Screening”). Information that you submit through
                the Site for the purpose of such Screening shall be treated in
                accordance with the Privacy Policy. Your submission of the
                information requested for a Screening shall constitute your
                consent to the Screening process. Screenings also may be
                governed by other Additional Requirements as may be disclosed
                to you in connection with the Screening. You acknowledge that
                you will address any issues or concerns with any Screenings,
                including the results of any Screenings, by contacting the
                appropriate property manager or owner, or as otherwise
                permitted under the Additional Requirements applicable to the
                Screening or as otherwise required by law. Yardi shall not
                become involved in Screening related issues except where the
                issue is solely attributable to a malfunction or error
                occurring on the Site or in connection with the Services or as
                otherwise specified in the Additional Requirements applicable
                to the Screening or as otherwise required by law. 6.5
                Payments. Except as expressly provided below, any payments you
                submit through the Site including rental deposits, rental
                payments, or any other services or transactions including but
                not limited to the return of security deposits, are for
                services provided by a property manager, owner or a party
                other than Yardi. The total payment amounts required for those
                transactions are determined solely by you and any other party
                with whom you are entering into an agreement or have an
                existing agreement with, and not by Yardi. You acknowledge
                that you will address any discrepancies, issues or concerns
                with such total payment amounts by contacting the other party
                directly, rather than Yardi. Yardi shall not be involved in
                such issues except where the issue is solely attributable to a
                malfunction or error occurring on the Site or in connection
                with the Services. You expressly acknowledge that any payments
                made by you to a property manager, owner, or a party other
                than Yardi (“Payee”), will be submitted to Yardi, as a payment
                collection agent of the Payee, solely for the limited purpose
                of accepting and processing such payments. The delivery of the
                payment by you to Yardi, which acts as the limited payment
                collection agent of the Payee shall satisfy your payment
                obligation to the Payee. Once such payment is received by
                Yardi on your behalf, you authorize Yardi to electronically
                credit the funds into the bank account designated by you
                (e.g., the bank account belonging to the Payee). In the event
                that Yardi does not properly remit any such payment amounts to
                the Payee, the Payee will only have recourse against Yardi and
                not you directly. Assuming you have tendered the proper amount
                of funds due to us, your payment obligation to the Payee is
                extinguished upon our receipt of the funds. There is no risk
                of loss to you if Yardi fails to remit the funds to the Payee.
                For clarity, Users may take advantage of certain Services that
                have a charge associated with them such as screening services,
                lease execution fees, return of security deposit and the like,
                that is imposed by Yardi or another third-party, which may or
                may not be a subsidiary or affiliate of Yardi. Yardi or such
                other company may collect these fees directly from Users as
                provided by the Site or the Services. You acknowledge these
                fees are subject to change. Services-specific terms may set
                out further terms applying to such payments (including in
                relation to refunds (if any), billing arrangements and any
                consequences of failing to make timely payments). Application
                fees are non-refundable, even if an application is denied,
                except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. You
                must comply with all such terms in relation to such payments
                by you. By providing your card or bank information, you are
                representing that you are authorized to use this card or bank
                account for payments for rental deposits, rental payments, or
                any other services or transactions for services provided by a
                property manager, property owner or a party other than Yardi.
                Any personal information provided by you in connection with
                the transaction will be stored by Yardi. You authorize Yardi
                to store your card or bank information after completion of the
                transaction, so that you may use it for future transactions or
                if you are enrolling in recurring payments, so that Yardi may
                process your recurring payments. You are responsible for
                keeping your card or bank information up to date. If your card
                or bank information changes, you agree to promptly update your
                information. Yardi will continue to store your card or bank
                information until you delete your information or you cancel
                recurring payments. For more information about how we store
                and use your card, bank or other personal information, please
                see our Privacy Policy. Applicable only in the United States
                (and not applicable in Canada): You expressly acknowledge that
                any payments made by you to a party other than Yardi
                (“Payee”), will be submitted to Yardi as a payment collection
                agent of the Payee, solely for the limited purpose of
                accepting and processing such payments. The delivery of the
                payment by you to Yardi, which acts as the limited payment
                collection agent of the Payee, shall satisfy your payment
                obligation to the Payee. Once such payment is received by
                Yardi on your behalf, you authorize Yardi to electronically
                credit the funds into the bank account designated by you
                (e.g., the bank account belonging to the Payee). In the event
                that Yardi does not properly remit any such payment amounts to
                the Payee, the Payee will only have recourse against Yardi and
                not you directly. Assuming you have tendered the proper amount
                of funds due to us, your payment obligation to the Payee is
                satisfied upon our receipt of the funds. There is no risk of
                loss to you if Yardi fails to remit the funds to the Payee.
                6.6 Electronic Signatures. If you choose to use the electronic
                signature execution functionality of RentCafe, you understand,
                acknowledge and agree that you have carefully reviewed the
                disclosure relating to use of your electronic signature to
                execute documents and will not execute such documents with
                your electronic signature without providing your consent to
                use your electronic signature. You agree that you will rely on
                your own legal counsel to determine the sufficiency of the
                electronic signature execution of the documents and their
                enforceability and that Yardi makes no warranty or other
                representation with respect to the sufficiency of the
                electronic signature execution of the documents under
                applicable international, national, federal, state, provincial
                or local laws or regulations. 6.7 Identity Verification
                Services. You acknowledge that by using identity verification
                services, you give your express written consent to, if
                applicable: (i) send and receive text messages associated with
                the identity verification services, including text messages to

                services); and (ii) have your “selfie” image used in the

                you agree that the images may be scanned and compared to your
                identification documents for authentication purposes and that
                you have read and understand our Privacy Policy and Jumio

              <p class="mil-mb-40">
                19.1 Governing Law. For all legal proceedings arising out of
                use of the Site and/or relating to the Terms, these Terms and
                the relationship between you and Company shall, irrespective
                of any choice of laws rules, be governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the State in which the property is
                located. You and Company hereby irrevocably and
                unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of courts located
                in the County in which the property is located or the court of
                competent jurisdiction closest thereto if no court of
                competent jurisdiction resides therein, and the parties
                consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and
                expressly waive any right they may otherwise have to cause any
                such action or proceeding to be brought or tried elsewhere.
                You and Company irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
                permitted by law, any objection that you may now or hereafter
                have to the laying of the venue of any proceeding brought in
                any such court or any claim that a legal proceeding commenced
                in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 19.2
                Assignment. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in
                whole or in part, without the prior written consent of
                Company, which may be granted or withheld by Company in its
                their sole discretion. Any attempted assignment in violation
                of this Section will be null and void and of no force or
                effect. Company may assign this Agreement freely at any time
                without notice. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will
                bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted
                successors and assigns. 19.3 Waiver. The failure to exercise
                or enforce any right or provision shall not affect Company’s
                right to exercise or enforce such right or provision at any
                time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default
                of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or
                default or a waiver of the provision itself. 19.4
                Severability. If any portion of these Terms is found by a
                court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
                unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
                should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
                reflected in such provision, and, notwithstanding such
                finding, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain
                in full force and effect. 19.5 Entire Agreement. These Terms,
                the terms incorporated herein, and any other terms agreed to
                in writing by the parties or by way of your use of the Site or
                the Services shall constitute the entire and exclusive
                understanding and agreement between you and Company regarding
                this subject matter, and shall supersede any and all prior or
                contemporaneous representations or understandings relating to
                this subject matter. 19.6 Time Limitation. You agree that
                regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
                cause of action arising out of or related to the Terms or use
                of the Site must be filed within 1 year after such claim or
                cause of action arose or be forever barred. 19.7 Other Terms.
                With the exception of those situations where Yardi acts in the
                capacity of a payment collection agent of a Payee, as
                expressly set forth herein, neither party is an agent,
                representative, or partner of the other party. Neither party

                association, agency, joint venture or partnership between the
                parties or to impose any liability attributable to such a
                relationship upon either party. Updated: July 24, 2023
